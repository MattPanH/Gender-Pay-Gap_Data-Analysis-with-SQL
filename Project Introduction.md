The client is a UK government department, concerned with monitoring the gender pay gap across different industries. I was tasked to carry out data analysis of gender pay gap data submitted by UK companies and summarize my findings in a report and presentation aimed at non-technical policy makers working for the government.

The following questions were considered in my data analysis:
<br/>1) What is the overall gender pay gap for men and women?
<br/>2) What is the average pay gap for companies with different number of employees?
<br/>3) What is the average pay gap in different parts of the UK?
<br/>4) What is the average pay gap for different sectors?
<br/>5) Which companies have the highest pay gaps?

The data is accessed from General Assembly Servers and queried using PostgreSQL. The dataset is uploaded on the repository for easy reference.
