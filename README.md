<h2> Introduction </h2>
The client is a UK government department, concerned with monitoring the gender pay gap across different industries. I was tasked to carry out data analysis of gender pay gap data submitted by UK companies and summarize my findings in a report and presentation aimed at non-technical policy makers working for the government.

<br>
<h2> Gender Pay Gap Questions </h2>1) What is the overall gender pay gap for men and women?
<br/>2) What is the average pay gap for companies with different number of employees?
<br/>3) What is the average pay gap in different parts of the UK?
<br/>4) What is the average pay gap for different sectors?
<br/>5) Which companies have the highest pay gaps?
<br>

<h2> Data Source </h2>
The data is accessed from General Assembly Servers and queried using PostgreSQL. The dataset is uploaded on the repository for easy reference.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Data Limitation </h2>
The data is not granular enough to establish if equal work was performed and cannot be used to make claims of unequal pay. Instead, the data tells us which companies, locations, and sectors are hiring less women for senior or highly paid roles.
